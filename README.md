The program works well for the most part, as it randomly picks a restaurant using a switch statement depending on what input the user types. However, there is a slight problem if the player enters an invalid input. While it does print "Invalid Input" the first time, it will continue to the ending input if you enter an invalid input more than once, or will just go there the first time if you press enter without inputting anything, so that part could definitely use a little work. Though, aside from that, it still does what it is supposed to do.
